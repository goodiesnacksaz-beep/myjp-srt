# 🎯 Progress Tracker Fixed - Global Singleton Issue

## The Problem (Found!)

From your console logs, I identified the exact issue:

### What Was Happening:
1. ✅ Upload route: `ProgressTracker.start()` and `ProgressTracker.update()` were being called
2. ✅ Server logs showed: `📊 Progress: 10/88 (11%)`, `20/88 (23%)`, etc.
3. ❌ Progress API: **Always returned** `hasProgress: false, percentage: 0`

### Root Cause:
**Next.js Module Instance Issue**

Next.js compiles different routes separately. When you have:
- `/api/upload/route.ts` (calls `ProgressTracker.start()`)
- `/api/files/[id]/progress/route.ts` (calls `ProgressTracker.get()`)

They were using **different instances** of the `progressMap` variable!

```
Upload Route → ProgressTracker Instance A → Map A (has data)
Progress API → ProgressTracker Instance B → Map B (empty!)
```

This is a common issue in Next.js during development with hot module reloading.

## The Fix

Changed from regular module-level variable to **global singleton**:

### Before:
```typescript
const progressMap = new Map<string, ProcessingProgress>();
```

### After:
```typescript
const globalForProgress = global as unknown as {
    progressMap: Map<string, ProcessingProgress> | undefined;
};

const progressMap = globalForProgress.progressMap ?? new Map<string, ProcessingProgress>();
globalForProgress.progressMap = progressMap;
```

This ensures **one single Map instance** shared across all routes, even with hot reloading.

## How to Test

1. **Restart the dev server** (the global fix requires a fresh start)

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. **Upload the test SRT file again**

3. **Navigate to the file details page**

4. **You should now see:**

**Server Console:**
```
📊 Progress tracking started for xxx: 88 words
📊 ProgressTracker.get(xxx) found: { stage: 'looking-up', currentWord: 10, totalWords: 88 }
📊 Progress API for xxx: {
  hasProgress: true,    ← NOW TRUE!
  percentage: 11,       ← NOW ACCURATE!
  stage: 'looking-up',
  currentWord: 10,
  totalWords: 88
}
```

**Browser:**
- Loading bar should now show real progress!
- Percentage should update from 0% → 11% → 23% → ... → 100%
- Should show "Processing word 10 of 88"

## Why This Pattern?

The `global` object pattern is the **recommended approach** for maintaining singleton state in Next.js:

- Used by Prisma client (`globalThis.prisma`)
- Survives hot module reloading
- Shared across all route handlers
- Only one instance in memory

## Expected Behavior Now

1. **Upload file** → Progress starts at 0%
2. **Progress API called** every 2 seconds → Returns actual progress
3. **Loading bar updates** in real-time: 0% → 11% → 23% → 34% → ... → 100%
4. **Shows current word** being looked up
5. **Completes** when all words are processed

The progress bar should finally work! 🎉
