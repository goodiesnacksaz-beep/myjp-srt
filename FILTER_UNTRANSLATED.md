# ‚úÖ Filter Out Untranslated Words

## Change Made

Words without translations are now **automatically excluded** from the vocabulary list.

## Before vs After

### Before ‚ùå
```
‰∫∫	„Å´„Çì	Translation not found
Áä¨	„ÅÑ„Å¨	dog
Áå´	„Å≠„Åì	cat
xyz	xyz	Translation not found
```

### After ‚úÖ
```
Áä¨	„ÅÑ„Å¨	dog
Áå´	„Å≠„Åì	cat
```

Only words with actual translations are saved!

## How It Works

### 1. During Dictionary Lookup
```typescript
const meaning = await Dictionary.lookup(word);

if (meaning && meaning !== "Translation not found") {
  // ‚úÖ Save this word - has translation
  vocabulary.push({ word, reading, meaning, ... });
} else {
  // ‚ö†Ô∏è Skip this word - no translation
  console.log(`Skipping "${word}" - no translation found`);
}
```

### 2. Error Handling
If a lookup fails (timeout, network error, etc.):
```typescript
catch (error) {
  // ‚ö†Ô∏è Skip this word too - don't save without translation
  console.log(`Skipping "${word}" due to lookup error`);
}
```

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Cleaner vocabulary lists** - Only useful words  
‚úÖ **No "Translation not found" entries** - All words are meaningful  
‚úÖ **Better user experience** - Users only see words they can learn  
‚úÖ **Console logging** - Shows which words were skipped (for debugging)  

## What You'll See in Console

When processing, you'll see:
```
üîç Looking up "‰∫∫È°û" via API...
‚úÖ Found "‰∫∫È°û": mankind, humanity

üîç Looking up "xyz" via API...
‚ùå No meaning found for "xyz"
‚ö†Ô∏è Skipping "xyz" - no translation found

üîç Looking up "Áä¨" via API...
‚úÖ Found "Áä¨": dog

‚úÖ Vocabulary extraction complete: 98 words with meanings
```

Notice: Only 98 words saved instead of 100, because 2 had no translations!

## Common Reasons for No Translation

1. **Katakana names** - Character names, place names
2. **Rare/archaic words** - Not in Jisho dictionary
3. **Typos in subtitles** - Misspelled words
4. **Sound effects** - Text representing sounds
5. **Abbreviations** - Non-standard abbreviations
6. **Partial words** - Tokenizer split incorrectly

## Example Words That Might Get Skipped

### Character Names (Katakana)
- „Ç®„É¨„É≥ (Eren) - proper name
- „Éü„Ç´„Çµ (Mikasa) - proper name

### Sound Effects
- „Ç¨„Ç¨„Ç¨ - sound effect
- „Éâ„Éâ„Éâ - sound effect

### Rare/Special Words
- Very rare kanji compounds
- Regional dialects
- Made-up words in fiction

## Database Impact

### Before
```sql
-- 100 vocabulary entries, some with "Translation not found"
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Vocabulary WHERE fileId = 'xxx';
-- Result: 100
```

### After
```sql
-- Only entries with actual translations
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Vocabulary WHERE fileId = 'xxx';
-- Result: 98 (2 were skipped)
```

## File Statistics Update

The file statistics will now show:
- **Vocabulary Count**: Only words with translations
- **More accurate** learning metrics
- **Better quiz quality** - No untranslatable words in quizzes

## Testing

To test this works:

1. Upload a file with some rare/untranslatable words
2. Check console for `‚ö†Ô∏è Skipping` messages
3. Verify vocabulary list only shows translated words
4. No "Translation not found" entries should appear

## Edge Cases Handled

### Empty Meaning
```typescript
meaning = null
// ‚úÖ Skipped
```

### "Translation not found" String
```typescript
meaning = "Translation not found"
// ‚úÖ Skipped
```

### Error During Lookup
```typescript
throw new Error("Network error")
// ‚úÖ Skipped (caught in catch block)
```

### Timeout
```typescript
timeout of 10000ms exceeded
// ‚úÖ Skipped (caught in catch block)
```

## Performance Impact

### Positive
- ‚úÖ **Smaller database** - Less storage used
- ‚úÖ **Faster queries** - Fewer records to filter
- ‚úÖ **Better quality** - Only useful data

### Neutral
- Processing time same (still looks up all words)
- API calls same (needs to check to know if valid)

## Statistics Logging

You'll see in console:
```
Found 450 unique words before filtering
150 words meet minimum frequency of 2
Looking up meanings for 100 words using Jisho API...
‚ö†Ô∏è Skipping "xyz" - no translation found
‚ö†Ô∏è Skipping "abc" - no translation found
‚úÖ Vocabulary extraction complete: 98 words with meanings
Vocabulary extraction completed for file xxx: 98 words saved
```

Clear indication of:
- How many words were found
- How many met frequency threshold
- How many were attempted
- How many were skipped
- How many were actually saved

## User Benefits

1. **Cleaner lists** - No confusing entries
2. **Better learning** - All words are learnable
3. **Quality quizzes** - No untranslatable words in tests
4. **Trust** - Users trust the app more with quality data
5. **Less clutter** - Vocabulary lists are more focused

**Result**: Your vocabulary lists now contain only high-quality, translatable words! üéØ‚ú®
