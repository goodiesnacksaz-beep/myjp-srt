# âœ… Loading Bar Fixed - Word Progress Tracking

## What Was Fixed

The loading bar has been completely refactored to show **real-time word lookup progress** instead of generic extraction progress.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Progress Tracker (`lib/progress-tracker.ts`)**
- Renamed `currentStep/totalSteps` to `currentWord/totalWords` for clarity
- Changed stages to be more descriptive:
  - `starting` - Initial setup
  - `processing` - Text analysis
  - `looking-up` - Dictionary lookups (main stage)
  - `saving` - Database save
  - `complete` - Finished
- Added logging every 10 words
- Cap percentage at 99% until truly complete

### 2. **Vocabulary Extractor (`lib/vocabulary-extractor.ts`)**
- Reset progress tracker with actual word count after tokenization
- Update progress **for every single word** being looked up
- Show current word being processed: `"Looking up: 'äºº' (23/100)"`
- Progress now directly reflects dictionary lookup progress

### 3. **Loading Progress Component (`components/LoadingProgress.tsx`)**
- Added `currentWord` and `totalWords` props
- Display: "Processing word X of Y"
- Show stage badge (e.g., "LOOKING UP")
- Added percentage clamping (0-100%)
- Smoother animations (300ms transition)

### 4. **File Details Page (`app/files/[id]/page.tsx`)**
- Fetch and pass `currentWord` and `totalWords` from API
- Poll every 2 seconds for real-time updates

### 5. **Progress API (`app/api/files/[id]/progress/route.ts`)**
- Return `currentWord` and `totalWords` in response
- Match new progress tracker field names

## How It Works Now

1. **Upload SRT file** â†’ Initial estimate of 100 words
2. **Text analysis** â†’ Count exact number of unique words
3. **Dictionary lookups** â†’ Progress updates for EACH word:
   - Current: 1/87 (1%)
   - Current: 10/87 (11%)
   - Current: 50/87 (57%)
   - Complete: 87/87 (100%)

## Visual Improvements

- **Spinning loader** with percentage in center
- **Stage badge** showing current phase
- **Word counter**: "Processing word 23 of 87"
- **Progress message**: Shows which word is being looked up
- **Smooth progress bar** with gradient and shimmer effect
- **Real-time updates** every 2 seconds

## Console Output

When processing, you'll see:
```
ðŸ“Š Progress tracking started for clxxx: 87 words
ðŸ“Š Progress: 10/87 (11%)
ðŸ“Š Progress: 20/87 (22%)
ðŸ“Š Progress: 30/87 (34%)
...
âœ… Progress complete for clxxx: 85 words saved
```

## Test It

1. Upload a new SRT file
2. Navigate to the file details page
3. Watch the loading bar show:
   - Current word count (e.g., "Processing word 23 of 87")
   - Percentage based on words processed
   - Specific word being looked up
   - Smooth progress from 0% â†’ 99% â†’ 100%

The percentage now **accurately reflects word lookup progress**, which is the longest part of the process!

## Notes

- Percentage caps at 99% during processing, hits 100% only when complete
- Progress automatically clears 30 seconds after completion
- If you refresh the page, it will resume showing progress if still processing
- The loading bar updates every 2 seconds with fresh data from the server
