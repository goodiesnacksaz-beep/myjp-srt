# ✅ Loading Progress Bar Added!

## What's New

Instead of showing "No vocabulary extracted yet", the app now displays:

### 🎨 **Beautiful Loading Bar** with:
- ✅ **Real-time percentage** (0-100%)
- ✅ **Animated spinner** with percentage inside
- ✅ **Progress bar** with gradient and shimmer effect
- ✅ **Current stage** (TOKENIZING, EXTRACTING, SAVING)
- ✅ **Status message** (e.g., "Looking up word 45 of 100...")
- ✅ **Auto-refresh** every 2 seconds while processing

## How It Works

### 1. Progress Tracking System
- Tracks each stage of vocabulary extraction
- Updates progress every 50 subtitles processed
- Updates progress every 10 words looked up
- Stores progress in memory (fast access)

### 2. API Endpoint
- `/api/files/[id]/progress` - Get current progress
- Returns percentage, stage, message, and completion status

### 3. Auto-Polling
- File details page automatically polls every 2 seconds
- Shows live progress updates
- Stops polling when complete

## Stages Shown

1. **PARSING** (0-5%) - Reading SRT file
2. **TOKENIZING** (5-80%) - Analyzing Japanese text
3. **EXTRACTING** (80-95%) - Looking up word meanings
4. **SAVING** (95-99%) - Saving to database
5. **COMPLETE** (100%) - Shows vocabulary table

## What You'll See

### When uploading a file:

**Initial upload:**
```
File uploaded successfully! Extracting vocabulary...
```

**On file details page:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         🔄 42%                       │
│       TOKENIZING                     │

│  ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░    │
│         Processing... 42%            │
│  This usually takes 30-60 seconds    │
│  The page will auto-update when      │
│           complete                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**When dictionary lookups start:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         🔄 87%                       │

│         Processing... 87%            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**When complete:**

## Files Changed

### New Files:
- ✅ `lib/progress-tracker.ts` - Progress tracking system
- ✅ `app/api/files/[id]/progress/route.ts` - Progress API endpoint
- ✅ `components/LoadingProgress.tsx` - Beautiful loading component

### Modified Files:
- ✅ `app/api/upload/route.ts` - Initialize and update progress
- ✅ `lib/vocabulary-extractor.ts` - Report progress during extraction
- ✅ `app/files/[id]/page.tsx` - Show loading component and poll for updates

## Technical Details

### Progress Tracking
```typescript
// Stored in memory (fast)
interface ProcessingProgress {
  fileId: string;
  stage: 'parsing' | 'tokenizing' | 'extracting' | 'saving' | 'complete';
  currentStep: number;
  totalSteps: number;
  message: string;
}
```

### Auto-Cleanup
- Progress data auto-deletes after 30 seconds of completion
- Prevents memory leaks
- Fresh start for each upload

### Polling Strategy
- Polls every 2 seconds while `isProcessing: true`
- Stops automatically when complete
- Also refreshes file data to get new vocabulary

## Test It Now!

```bash
# Start server if not running
npm run dev

# Upload a file
http://localhost:3000/upload

# After upload, you'll be redirected to file details
# Watch the beautiful loading bar! 🎉
```

## Expected Behavior

1. **Upload file** → See "File uploaded successfully!"
2. **Redirected to file page** → See animated loading bar
3. **Progress updates every 2 seconds**:
   - Shows current stage
   - Shows percentage
   - Shows specific message
4. **When complete** → Vocabulary table appears automatically
5. **No manual refresh needed** → Everything is automatic!

## Benefits

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ❌ "Processing may be in progress" | ✅ "Looking up word 45 of 100..." |
| ❌ No feedback | ✅ Real-time percentage |
| ❌ Manual refresh button | ✅ Auto-updates every 2s |
| ❌ Unknown wait time | ✅ "Usually takes 30-60 seconds" |
| ❌ Boring text | ✅ Beautiful animated UI |

## Troubleshooting

### If progress bar doesn't appear:
1. Check console for errors
2. Make sure you're on the file details page
3. Try refreshing the page manually
4. Check if file already has vocabulary (won't show progress)

### If it gets stuck:
1. Progress might have cleaned up (after 30s of completion)
2. Refresh the page
3. Check server console for errors
