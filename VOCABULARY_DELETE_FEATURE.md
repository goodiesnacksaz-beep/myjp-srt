# ‚úÖ Vocabulary Delete Feature Added

## What's New

Users can now delete individual vocabulary items from their vocabulary list!

## Changes Made

### 1. **New API Endpoint** (`app/api/vocabulary/[id]/route.ts`)

**DELETE `/api/vocabulary/[id]`**

- Deletes a single vocabulary item by ID
- Security: Verifies the vocabulary belongs to the user's file
- Returns success/error response
- Logs deletion for tracking

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Vocabulary item deleted successfully"
}
```

### 2. **Updated Vocabulary List UI** (`app/files/[id]/page.tsx`)

Added:
- **New "Actions" column** in the vocabulary table
- **Delete button** for each vocabulary item with trash icon
- **Confirmation dialog** before deletion
- **Loading state** while deleting (shows spinner)
- **Optimistic UI update** - removes item from list immediately after successful deletion
- **Row hover effect** for better UX

## Features

### ‚úÖ Confirmation Before Delete
When user clicks delete, they see:
```
Are you sure you want to delete "‰∫∫" from your vocabulary list?
```

### ‚úÖ Loading State
While deleting:
- Button shows "Deleting..." with spinner
- Button is disabled to prevent double-clicks
- Other rows remain interactive

### ‚úÖ Security
- User must own the file containing the vocabulary
- Authentication required
- Authorization check on the server

### ‚úÖ Immediate UI Feedback
- Item disappears from list immediately after deletion
- No need to refresh the page
- Vocabulary count updates automatically

## UI Preview

**Before:**
```
| Word | Reading | Meaning | Frequency | Context |
|------|---------|---------|-----------|---------|
| ‰∫∫   | „Å≤„Å®    | person  | 12x       | ...     |
```

**After:**
```
| Word | Reading | Meaning | Frequency | Context | Actions    |
|------|---------|---------|-----------|---------|------------|
| ‰∫∫   | „Å≤„Å®    | person  | 12x       | ...     | [üóëÔ∏è Delete] |
```

## Delete Button States

1. **Normal State:**
   - Red text with trash icon
   - Shows "Delete"
   - Hover effect (darker red)

2. **Deleting State:**
   - Spinner animation
   - Shows "Deleting..."
   - Button disabled
   - Reduced opacity

3. **After Delete:**
   - Row removed from table
   - Count updated

## Code Flow

1. User clicks "Delete" button
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. If confirmed:
   - Set `deletingId` to show loading state
   - Call DELETE API endpoint
   - If successful:
     - Remove item from local state
     - Update UI immediately
   - If error:
     - Show error message
     - Keep item in list
4. Clear `deletingId` to reset button state

## Error Handling

- **Item not found**: "Vocabulary item not found"
- **Unauthorized**: User doesn't own the file
- **Network error**: "An error occurred while deleting the vocabulary item"
- All errors shown via alert dialog

## Accessibility

- ‚úÖ `aria-label` for screen readers
- ‚úÖ `title` attribute for tooltips
- ‚úÖ Disabled state when deleting
- ‚úÖ Keyboard navigation support
- ‚úÖ Visual feedback for all states

## Testing

To test the feature:

1. **Navigate to a file details page** with vocabulary
2. **Click the "Delete" button** on any vocabulary item
3. **Confirm the deletion** in the dialog
4. **Watch the item disappear** from the list
5. **Check the vocabulary count** (should decrease by 1)

## Database Impact

- Deletes from `Vocabulary` table
- Doesn't affect the original `SubtitleFile`
- Doesn't affect quiz attempts (they may reference deleted vocab)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Bulk delete (select multiple items)
- Undo delete functionality
- Soft delete (keep in database but hide)
- Delete confirmation with checkbox ("Don't ask again")
- Toast notifications instead of alerts

## Notes

- Deletion is **permanent** - no undo
- Deleting vocab items doesn't affect the original SRT file
- The vocabulary count in file statistics updates automatically
- If all vocabulary is deleted, the "Start Quiz" button should still work (but may show no questions)
